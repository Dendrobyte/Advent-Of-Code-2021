# Advent of Code 2021 - Mark Bacon

Advent of Code submissions for 2021. They've started off pretty easy so I feel pretty good about getting them done.

## Information

At least until the 17th or 18th, these solutions won't be very creative. Once my final papers wrap up, I look forward to [livestreaming these on my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/markbacon78) as a part of a series I'll be starting called "Leetcode Livestreams". A nice, creative way to kick things off!

Make sure to try challenges on your own before you do this. I'll start commenting the code when it gets unreadable. If you want comments or explanations, reach out to me on [Twitter at @Mobkinz78](http://www.twitter.com/Mobkinz78) and I'll add those! It might not be as readable for beginners as I realize.

Lastly, I chose Python because it's a quick language and I'm looking to get very good at it for interview questions in the inevitable future. Thanks for stopping by!

- [x] Day 1 -- [Day 1 Python File](Day_1.py) | [Part 2](Day_1-2.py)
 - Time: 6 minutes
 - Log: Very straightforward. Just iterating through lines and adding up the respective numbers. I believe I had to add 1 before submitting the response due to an issue with the last index I wasn't feeling like fixing.

- [x] Day 2 -- [Day X Python File](Day_2.py) | [Part 2](Day_2-2.py)
 - Time: 9 minutes
 - Log: That shouldn't have taken me that long. Nonetheless, I would like to revisit this one to see if there's a more brief solution, but honestly I think this might just be as concise as it gets for efficient yet readable code (but with Python... you never know what secrets lay hidden beneath).
